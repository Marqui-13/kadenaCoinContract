# Kadena Coin Contract - Testnet Version

This repository contains a PACT smart contract designed for the Kadena blockchain, specifically for use on the Kadena testnet. This environment allows developers to test and interact with smart contracts without the financial implications of the mainnet.

## Overview

The coin contract enables functionalities such as:

	- Initialization Function: init function inserts an initial record for the admin account with a balance of 1000.0. This function is typically called once when the contract is first deployed to set up the initial state.
	- Balance Inquiry: The balance function allows querying the balance of a specified account by reading from the accounts table.
	- Transfer Function: transfer facilitates moving a specified amount of tokens from one account to another, including checks for positive transfer amounts and sufficient funds.

A few points to consider for real-world applications or further development:

	- Permissions: The contract lacks explicit permission checks for operations like transferring tokens. In a production environment, you would likely need to implement authorization checks to ensure only account owners (or authorized parties) can initiate transfers.
	- Error Handling: While the contract includes basic enforcement checks (e.g., for positive amounts and sufficient funds), comprehensive error handling would be beneficial for clarity and security.
	- Keyset Management: The 'admin-keyset is referenced but not defined within this snippet. In practice, youâ€™d set up this keyset in the Kadena blockchain to control access to administrative functions.

For deployment and interaction, make sure you have the necessary tools and access to the Kadena blockchain (e.g., via Chainweaver or command-line tools) and understand how to work with keysets for security.


This version is tailored for testnet deployment, facilitating a risk-free environment to experiment and validate your contract's logic.

## Requirements

- A Kadena testnet account.
- Access to Chainweaver or another Kadena-compatible wallet/interface that supports testnet operations.
- Testnet KDA tokens, obtainable from faucets.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine to get started with the contract.
2. Ensure you have Chainweaver installed or access to a compatible interface for testnet interaction.

## Deploying the Contract on Testnet

1. Launch Chainweaver and select the Kadena testnet network.
2. Navigate to the contract deployment section.
3. Upload the `coin.pact` file from this repository.
4. Define your 'admin-keyset' with your testnet account's public key.
5. Deploy the contract to the testnet, utilizing testnet KDA for any transaction fees.

## Interacting with the Contract on Testnet

### Initialize the Contract
- Execute the `init` function to establish the admin account with its initial balance.

### Query Account Balance
- Invoke the `balance` function with an account name to check its current balance.

### Transfer Tokens
- Use the `transfer` function specifying the sender, recipient, and amount to initiate a token transfer.

## Testnet Resources

- **Faucets**: Obtain testnet KDA for transaction fees and testing via official Kadena faucets.
- **Documentation**: Refer to Kadena's official documentation for detailed guidance on testnet usage.
- **Community Support**: Join Kadena's community forums or chat channels for support and discussions.
